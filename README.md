============================================================================

Code for the Advanced Android Kotlin Testing Codelab 5.1-5.3

Introduction
------------

TO-DO Notes is an app where you to write down tasks to complete. The app displays them in a list.
You can then mark them as completed or not, filter them and delete them.

This codelab has four branches, representing different code states:

* [starter_code](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/android-testing/tree/starter_code)
* [end_codelab_1](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/android-testing/tree/end_codelab_1)
* [end_codelab_2](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/android-testing/tree/end_codelab_2)
* [end_codelab_3](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/android-testing/tree/end_codelab_3)

The codelabs in this series are:
* [Testing Basics](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/advanced-android-kotlin-training-testing-basics)
* [Introduction to Test Doubles and Dependency Injection](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/advanced-android-kotlin-training-testing-test-doubles)
* [Survey of Testing Topics](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/advanced-android-kotlin-training-testing-survey)


Pre-requisites
--------------

You should be familiar with:

* The Kotlin programming language, including [Kotlin coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) and their interaction with [Android Jetpack components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/coroutines).
* The following core Android Jetpack libraries: [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel),
 [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata),
  [Navigation Component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) and 
  [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding).
* Application architecture, following the pattern from the [Guide to app architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide) and [Android Fundamentals codelabs](https://developer.android.com/courses/kotlin-android-fundamentals/toc).


Getting Started
---------------

1. Download and run the app.
2. Check out one of the codelabs mentioned above.

Set up CI to forked
-------------------

### Firebase
1. Add your project on [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Move to Project settings > Service accounts
3. Generate new private key and download on local

### Google Cloud Platform
4. Enable Cloud Testing API on [Google Cloud Platform console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
5. Move to IAM
6. Add role Editor to service account at step.3

### GitHub
7. Move to GitHub Repository Settings > Secrets
8. New repository secret
   - `FTL_KEY_BASE64` set value `catã€€{downloaded-in-step3.json} | base64`
   - `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` set value `{project-id-in-step1}`

#### CI target branch
**default**
- end_codelab_1
- end_codelab_2
- end_codelab_3

If you add target branch, add it to `branches` in `.github/workflows/build_test.yml`
